# Advent Of Code, 2024

This project contains my Advent of Code puzzle input and solutions for 2024! ðŸ˜Ž

I was _going_ to write these solutions in Clojure but my friend and co-worker [skershaw](https://github.com/skershaw/kotlin-AoC-2024) did his in Kotlin as a way to learn the language. I've been somewhat interested in learning Go for a while, I decided to take a page out of his book and do the puzzles in Go this year.

Beware, I'm learning Go as I go and many of these solutions are probably going to be clunky and not-so-idiomatic. But they will be correct and hopefully get more idiomatic and less clunky as I code up more of them. ðŸ¤ž
